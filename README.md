# NATURAL-LANGUAGE-PROCESSING---Logistic-Regression
This code challenge focuses on building a logistic regression model to predict whether an individual's application for a credit card will be accepted. Beginning with data loading and inspection, the dataset's features are analyzed, revealing a mix of numerical and non-numerical features with missing entries. Subsequently, data preprocessing is conducted to handle missing values, convert non-numeric features into numeric ones, and scale the features. Exploratory data analysis follows, providing insights into feature distributions and relationships. Finally, a logistic regression model is trained and evaluated using relevant metrics to assess its predictive performance. Overall, the challenge covers essential steps in data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and model building for classification tasks.
